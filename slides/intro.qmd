## Welcome & framing

**Format**

* Short conceptual introductions
* Interactive notebook demonstrations
* Discussion-oriented, not tool-heavy


::: notes
Welcome everyone and thank them for coming.

Briefly introduce yourself and your affiliation with NTNU and PoliMi LaBS.

Explain that this seminar is meant to be practical and concept-driven:
not a full course, not a software tutorial, but a guided exploration of
how global sensitivity analysis helps us reason about uncertainty in models.

Emphasize that notebooks are used as a medium for explanation and exploration,
not something participants are expected to run line-by-line during the seminar.

Set expectations for interaction and questions throughout the sessions.

## Why sensitivity analysis?

::: {.incremental}
- Models are nonlinear
- Parameters are uncertain
- Local derivatives fail
:::



::: notes
Here I motivate why local sensitivity analysis is insufficient.
Emphasize uncertainty and nonlinearity, and connect to real models.

## What we will do today

- Revisit basic statistics
- Introduce variance-based SA
- Explore interactive notebooks

## From a VUCA world to uncertainty-aware modelling
::: {.incremental}
* Engineering decisions are increasingly made in a **VUCA context**
  *(Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity)*
* Models are essential tools for reasoning under uncertainty
* However, models are:
  * based on uncertain inputs
  * built on simplifying assumptions
  * often nonlinear and high-dimensional
* **Uncertainty quantification (UQ)** provides a systematic framework
  to represent, propagate, and interpret uncertainty in models
:::

## Digital twins need global sensitivity analysis
::: {.incremental}
* **Digital twins** rely on models to support monitoring, prediction, and decision-making
* In practice, digital twins operate under:
  * uncertain data
  * uncertain parameters
  * evolving system states
* **Global sensitivity analysis (GSA)** is a key component of UQ:

  * identifies which uncertainties matter most
  * reveals interactions and nonlinear effects
  * supports robust and transparent decisions
* Without GSA, digital twins risk being precise but **not reliable**

## Main objectives of sensitivity

::: {.incremental}
- **Factor prioritisation**  
  Identify which uncertain inputs contribute most to output uncertainty
- **Factor fixing (screening)**  
  Identify non-influential inputs that can be fixed without affecting results
- **Understanding model behaviour**  
  Reveal nonlinear effects and interactions between inputs
- **Supporting robust decisions**  
  Focus modelling, data collection, and calibration effort where it matters

## Why sensitivity analysis?

- Models are nonlinear
- Parameters are uncertain
- Local derivatives are limited

## From local to global sensitivity analysis

- Local (derivative-based) measures
- One-factor-at-a-time (OAT)
- Why they fail for nonlinear models

## Variance as a measure of importance

- Output variability as information
- Conditional expectation and variance
- Total variance decomposition

## Sobol indices – idea, not formulas

- First-order effects
- Total effects
- Interaction effects

## What notebooks will show

- Scatterplots vs derivatives
- Monte Carlo estimation
- Polynomial chaos estimation

## How to read sensitivity indices

- What they mean
- What they do not mean
- Typical pitfalls
