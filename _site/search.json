It describes the kind of world where many engineering and decision problems exist today.\nIn a VUCA world, systems change over time, data are uncertain, and many factors interact in complex ways. Decisions often have to be made even when information is incomplete.\nModels help us reason in this situation, but models are never perfect. They are based on assumptions, simplified descriptions of reality, and uncertain inputs. This means model results are always uncertain.\nUncertainty quantification (UQ) helps us describe and propagate this uncertainty. It tells us how uncertain the model output is.\nBut, as emphasized by Saltelli, this is not enough for decision-making. In practice, we also need to know which uncertainties matter most.\nThis is why sensitivity analysis is essential in a VUCA context: it helps us understand which inputs drive the uncertainty in the results, and where modelling effort, data collection, or attention should be focused."

This is driven by ethics, cost, time, and feasibility: we want to reduce animal testing, limit human exposure, and explore rare or infeasible scenarios.\nThis raises the key question on this slide: when is a computational result credible — and why should we trust it? Here, credibility is used in the ASME sense. A result is credible when there is sufficient evidence that the model is adequate for its context of use. Trust is the consequence — we trust a result because we understand why it is credible.\nCrucially, credibility is not about removing uncertainty everywhere. It is about understanding which uncertainties matter for the decision, and which do not. This point is central in ASME V&V and in Aldieri’s work on credibility assessment.\nUncertainty quantification tells us how uncertain a model result is. Global sensitivity analysis tells us why it is uncertain — by identifying the dominant sources of uncertainty and risk.\nIn this sense, global sensitivity analysis operationalises credibility: it links uncertainty to decision relevance and shows where evidence and modelling effort actually matter."

Because of this, it operates under persistent uncertainty: data are noisy or incomplete, parameters are uncertain, and the system itself may evolve over time.\nAt the same time, decisions still have to be made. We cannot remove all uncertainty, so the key question again becomes: which uncertainties matter for the decisions the digital twin is used to support?\nIn the ASME sense, a digital twin is credible only if its results are robust for its intended context of use. Apparent precision is not enough.\nGlobal sensitivity analysis provides this link. It identifies which uncertainties are decision-relevant and where the model is sensitive or fragile. In that way, GSA supports credibility rather than just numerical accuracy.\nThis example sets the stage for the more general question: what problem sensitivity analysis actually solves.\nHere, precise means producing sharp, detailed outputs, often with many digits. Reliable means that those outputs are robust to uncertainty in data, parameters, and assumptions.\nWithout GSA, a digital twin may look accurate, while being highly sensitive to decision-relevant uncertainties. Apparent precision can therefore be misleading.\nTransition to next slide: Digital twins are just one example. The underlying issue is much more general. In any complex model used for decisions, we need to know which uncertainties actually matter."

And as models become nonlinear and high-dimensional, our intuition is no longer reliable. These points are important, but they are not very controversial.\nThe real motivation for sensitivity analysis lies in the last two points.\nDecisions require prioritisation. In practice, we cannot reduce all uncertainties. We do not have unlimited time, data, or resources, so we must decide where effort actually matters.\nThis is why sensitivity analysis is fundamentally about relevance. It tells us which uncertainties really drive the uncertainty in the model output, and which ones matter less for the question we are asking.\nIn other words, sensitivity analysis is not about explaining every detail of a model. It is about identifying what matters for decisions."

Among all uncertain inputs, which ones contribute most to the uncertainty in the model output? These are the parameters that deserve attention, better data, or careful calibration.\nThe second objective is factor fixing, also called screening. Here we identify inputs that have little influence on the output. If an input is not important, it can be fixed to a constant value without affecting the results, which simplifies the model.\nThe third objective is understanding model behaviour. Many models are nonlinear and include interactions between inputs. Sensitivity analysis helps reveal these effects and gives insight into how the model actually responds to uncertainty.\nThe final objective is supporting robust decisions. Instead of trying to improve everything, sensitivity analysis helps focus modelling, data collection, and validation effort where it matters most.\nThese objectives will guide the rest of the seminar. Different sensitivity analysis methods support different objectives, and there is no single “best” method for all purposes."

    "text": "From local to global sensitivity analysis\n\nLocal (derivative-based) measures\nOne-factor-at-a-time (OAT)\nWhy they fail for nonlinear models\n\n\nThe key message of this slide is very simple:\nLocal sensitivity looks at the model in one point. Global sensitivity looks at the model over the whole input space.\nLocal sensitivity methods use derivatives or small changes around a single reference point. They can be useful when the model is almost linear and uncertainty is very small.\nBut in most real problems:\n\nparameters are uncertain over wide ranges\nmodels are nonlinear\nparameters interact with each other\n\nIn these cases, local methods can be misleading. They may say an input is unimportant just because the derivative is small at that one point.\nGlobal sensitivity analysis takes uncertainty seriously. Inputs are varied over their full ranges, and we study how they affect the output variability.\nSo the important shift here is: we move from “What happens if I change one parameter a little bit?” to “Which uncertainties matter most for the overall behaviour of the model?”"

    "text": "Variance as a measure of importance\n\nOutput variability as information\nConditional expectation and variance\nTotal variance decomposition\n\n\nVariance is fundamental in global sensitivity analysis because it measures uncertainty in the model output.\nIf a model output has large variance, it means the prediction is uncertain. If the variance is small, the prediction is more stable. So variance gives us a natural way to quantify how uncertain the model result is.\nThe key idea in sensitivity analysis is to ask: How much of this output variance is caused by each input?\nThis is why variance is so useful. It can be decomposed into contributions from individual inputs and from their interactions. This is a central idea in Saltelli’s work.\nConditional expectation and conditional variance help us formalize this. If fixing one input significantly reduces the output variance, then that input is important. If fixing it changes little, then it is not very important.\nSo variance is not just a statistical choice. It directly connects uncertainty in the inputs to uncertainty in the output, and it allows us to rank inputs by how much they contribute to that uncertainty.\nThis is what makes variance the natural foundation for variance-based sensitivity measures, such as Sobol indices.\nSo once we agree that variance measures output uncertainty, the next step is to ask how this variance can be attributed to individual inputs this is exactly what Sobol indices do."

If this value is large, the input has a strong direct effect on the output.\nThe total Sobol index measures the overall effect of an input. This includes both its direct effect and all interactions with other inputs. If the total index is much larger than the first-order index, it means interactions are important.\nSobol indices also allow us to quantify interaction effects explicitly. This is something local or one-factor-at-a-time methods cannot capture.\nSo Sobol indices give us a clear and interpretable answer to the key question: which inputs, alone or in interaction, drive the uncertainty in the model output?\nThis is why they are so central in global sensitivity analysis, especially in complex and nonlinear models."

Scatterplots help us see input–output relationships directly, while Sobol indices give a quantitative measure of how important each input is for output uncertainty.\nWe start with a simple linear model, as used in the book by Saltelli. This is the simplest case and helps build intuition about variance and sensitivity.\nThen we move to standard benchmark models: the G-function and the Ishigami function. These models are nonlinear and include strong interaction effects, so they clearly show why global sensitivity analysis is needed.\nFinally, we look at an applied example: a wall model for blood flow simulation. This shows how the same ideas apply in a realistic engineering context.\nIn the notebooks, we will compute sensitivity indices using both Monte Carlo sampling and polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Both methods estimate the same quantities: the output variance and the Sobol indices. The difference is efficiency, not interpretation.\nThe goal is not to teach software or implementation details. The goal is to build intuition about uncertainty propagation and about how sensitivity analysis supports modelling and decision-making."
