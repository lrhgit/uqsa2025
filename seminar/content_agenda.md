## Description of programme blocks

### Welcome and overview

Introduction to the seminar goals, structure, and practical information.

### Motivation and context

Why uncertainty and sensitivity analysis matter in nonlinear and high-dimensional models, with examples from engineering and computational science.

### Probability and variance

A short refresher on random variables, variance, conditional variance, and the total law of variance — the statistical foundation underlying variance-based sensitivity analysis.

### From local to global sensitivity analysis

Limitations of derivative-based (local) sensitivity measures and the intuition behind variance-based global methods.

### Variance-based sensitivity indices

Conceptual introduction to Sobol indices and what they measure (first-order and total effects), with emphasis on interpretation rather than formal derivations.

### Interactive notebook walkthrough

Guided exploration of selected Jupyter/Colab notebooks illustrating:

* sampling of input parameter spaces
* scatterplots and conditional behaviour
* computation and interpretation of sensitivity indices

Participants are welcome to run the notebooks, but this is not required.

### Methods and comparison

Brief comparison of Monte Carlo–based and polynomial chaos–based approaches for computing sensitivity indices.

### Discussion and pointers

Interpretation, limitations, and suggestions for further reading and practical use.

## Practical information

The seminar combines demonstration with interactive exploration. Participants who wish to run code will be provided with ready-to-use notebooks and instructions.

Interactive notebooks and slides will be shared after the seminar.

Familiarity with basic probability and numerical modelling is helpful, but no prior experience with sensitivity analysis is assumed.
