## Description of programme blocks

### Welcome and overview

Introduction to the seminar goals, structure, and practical information.

### Motivation and context

Why uncertainty and sensitivity analysis matter in nonlinear and high-dimensional models, with examples from engineering and computational science.

### Probability and variance

A short refresher on random variables, variance, conditional variance, and the total law of variance — the statistical foundation underlying variance-based sensitivity analysis.

### From local to global sensitivity analysis

Limitations of derivative-based (local) sensitivity measures and the intuition behind variance-based global methods.

### Variance-based sensitivity indices

Conceptual introduction to Sobol indices and what they measure (first-order and total effects), focusing on interpretation rather than formal derivations.

### Interactive notebook walkthrough (hands-on)

Guided exploration of selected Jupyter/Colab notebooks. Participants are invited to run and experiment with prepared examples illustrating:

* sampling of input parameter spaces
* scatterplots and conditional behavior
* computation and interpretation of sensitivity indices

Participation in the hands-on part is encouraged but not mandatory.

### Methods and comparison

Brief comparison of Monte Carlo–based and polynomial chaos–based approaches for computing sensitivity indices.

### Discussion and pointers

Interpretation, limitations, and suggestions for further reading and practical use.

## Practical information

The seminar combines demonstration with a short, structured hands-on session. Participants who wish to run code will be provided with ready-to-use notebooks and instructions.

Interactive notebooks and slides will be shared after the seminar.

Familiarity with basic probability and numerical modeling is helpful, but no prior experience with sensitivity analysis is assumed.
