**Global Sensitivity Analysis: concepts, intuition, and practice**

This seminar provides an applied and intuitive introduction to global sensitivity analysis (GSA), with a focus on variance-based methods and their role in uncertainty quantification for computational models.

The seminar combines short conceptual explanations with interactive exploration using Jupyter/Colab notebooks.

## Agenda

1. **Motivation and context**
   Why uncertainty and sensitivity analysis matter in nonlinear and high-dimensional models, with examples from engineering and computational science.

2. **A short refresher on probability and variance**
   Random variables, variance, conditional variance, and the total law of variance — the statistical foundation underlying variance-based sensitivity analysis.

3. **From local to global sensitivity analysis**
   Limitations of derivative-based (local) sensitivity measures and the intuition behind variance-based global methods.

4. **Variance-based sensitivity indices**
   Conceptual introduction to Sobol indices and what they measure (first-order and total effects), without heavy formalism.

5. **Interactive notebook walkthrough**
   Guided exploration of a Jupyter/Colab notebook illustrating:

   * sampling of input parameter spaces
   * scatterplots and conditional behavior
   * computation and interpretation of sensitivity indices

6. **Methods and comparison**
   Brief comparison of Monte Carlo–based and polynomial chaos–based approaches for computing sensitivity indices.

7. **Discussion and pointers**
   Interpretation, limitations, and suggestions for further reading and practical use.

## Practical information

* The seminar is primarily demonstration-based; participants are **not expected to run code during the session**.
* Interactive notebooks and slides will be shared after the seminar.
* Familiarity with basic probability and numerical modeling is helpful, but no prior experience with sensitivity analysis is assumed.
